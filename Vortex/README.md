# Vortex
This is a modern text editor. To run Vortex simply run the following code and click on the popup window to begin typing
```
$ dune build
$ make play
```
Note that you must have clicked on the popup window as it must be in focus for you to be able to type to the editor which currently displays the text in the terminal that you ran the commands in. This will be changed later to make the window a stand-alone process.

To exit Vortex, press escape.
